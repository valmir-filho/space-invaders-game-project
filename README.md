- Verify Python Installation: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and run python3 --version;

- Install Pygame: Now, install Pygame using pip. In the terminal, run pip3 install pygame;

- Create the Game File: Open a text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad);
  
- Copy the Python code (space_invaders_game.py) into the editor;

- Save the file as space_invaders_game.py;

- Run the Game: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved space_invaders_game.py;

## Game Instructions:

- Your goal is to control the bird and make it fly through gaps between the pipes without hitting them;

- Press the SPACE key to make the bird jump upwards. If you don't press it, the bird will fall due to gravity;

- You earn points each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes without crashing;
   
- The bird must avoid hitting the pipes, both the top and bottom sections. If the bird hits a pipe, the game restarts;

- If the bird flies too high or falls off the screen, the game will restart;

- If you collide with a pipe or go off-screen, the game will automatically restart, and you can try again;

- Gravity continuously pulls the bird down, so you need to time your jumps using the SPACE key carefully;

- The pipes move from right to left, and gaps between them stay the same, but their positions vary randomly;
  
- Enjoy the game and see how many points you can score.

### Used IDE: Visual Studio Code.
